<P>

This is Twits End and you see no purpose to this room as you are not
yourself a bird and therefore do not understand bird things. This room
does seem to tax your brain somewhat (not being a Moog either) and it
would be advisable to leave quickly.
<P>

The path leads north, east and west, and of course there's always up...

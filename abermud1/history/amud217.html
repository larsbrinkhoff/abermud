<P>

You are now standing on the ledge of what appears to be a flying
building, it would seem that the Kings destination was not the Gods, but
a good party instead, as you hear the sounds of loud music and corks
flying inside.
<P>

Rather unfortunately for you, because you could do with a party just
now, it is closed to Mortals due to a shortage of drink, and will be
reopened in due course (as soon as the Creator gets round to laying in
new supplies). I do not appologise for the inconvenience, I mean have
you any idea what its like being a Creator, the loneliness of
responsibility, the futility of command, the...ah well...doesn't it stir
something in your heart! What do you mean NO! Luckily for you I have
left an exit Down to the Top of the Pit, and you can count yourself
lucky that I managed that...I mean the workload at present is quite
unbelievable, and I've got this project...so GO AWAY!!!! AND DONT BOTHER
ME AGAIN! (Grrrrrrrr.....)
<P>

Thankyou.... Moog the Creator

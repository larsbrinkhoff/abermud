<P>

You find yourself at the top of the tree in the centre of Doiley Woods,
in a tree house (of sorts...more like a Palace). From here you can see
the whole of this gaming world...to the south you can see a Mountain, to
the north there's a large sea, to the west you can make out a desert
(and is that a Pyramid), and various other things such as Walls, Cities,
Buildings, Motorways, and even a giant Banana...boy have you got some
surprises in store for you.
<P>

From here the only way out is back down the rope ladder.

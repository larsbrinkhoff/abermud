<P>

You are at the southern end of a dimly lit room. Just visible are three
huge vats of GUNK, with pipes leading to and from them on which are
written words like WATER, GLUE, CARAMEL, NITRIC, FONDANT... The vat
nearest you is full to the brim, but you can't reach in.
<P>

A staircase leads upwards to a noisy place, or you can go north to the
next vat.

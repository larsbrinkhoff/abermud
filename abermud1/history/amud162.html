<H1>You have reached the northern...</H1>

<A HREF=amud160.html>[south: 160]</A>
<A HREF=amud163.html>[west: 163]</A>
<P>

You have reached the northern extent of the desert and seem to have
successfully crossed the sea of sand. Here the sun is a little cooler,
and the desert seems to have conceeded to being beaten (this time!).
Down to the west lies a low sandy plateau, with some form of structure
to be seen in the distance.
<P>

Apart from back into the desert the only exit is west.

<A HREF=amud195.html>[up: 195]</A>
<P>

As you walk through the doors thay slam shut forming a wall on this side
with no visible means of opening. The only way to go is onwards...
<P>

You find yourself in a completely white room, with no obvious markings
to suggest its purpose. Light is streaming in through a slit in one
wall, through which you can see the desert floor far below, whilst above
a blanket of cloud surrounds the top of the pyramid. You can see a trap
door in the ceiling, just reachable from the floor.
<P>

The only out of here is upwards through the trap door.

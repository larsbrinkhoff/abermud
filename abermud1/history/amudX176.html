<H1>The Garden Of Memory</H1>

<P>

<P>

You are standing in the garden of memory, huge slabs lie in memory of
all those ever to pass from the BB into the real world.... At the
moment only one slab bears a message, that being a poem
<P>

 I stand in the void, 
 nowhere to go 
 Walking on slowly, 
 why I don't know.
 Plod slowly onwards, 
 no feeling there 
 Cos since you left me, 
 I just don't care 
 Anymore.......no no more
<P>

The rest of it is worn and chipped away and impossible to read save for
a little notice which reads
<P>

"If there is anyone who wants putting in the Garden Of Memory because
they are leaving, use the ? command to request it.... 
<P>

PS: They must have been regular BB users before..... "

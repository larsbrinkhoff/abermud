You are on the Poop Deck of this mystical boat, and you realise, from
looking, that the boat has arrived at its designed destination. A
gangplank leads north into a blanket of Mist (a rather patchy blanket),
inviting you to step into this higher plane... The steps still lead
down to the upper deck, but im afraid that this was a one way journey
only, no chance of getting out there!

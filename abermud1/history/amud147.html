<H1>You are in a small...</H1>

<A HREF=amud146.html>[east: 146]</A>
<A HREF=amud148.html>[west: 148]</A>
<P>

You are in a small dingy tunnel, obviously not a creation of nature.
<P>

The tunnel is magically lit, letting you see everything in detail. The
tunnel floor is loose dirt/gravel, and the roof is held up by wooden
supports in certain places. Here and there you see clear pick axe
marks, though no evidence of fresh digging is evident here.
<P>

The tunnel leads off to the east and the west.

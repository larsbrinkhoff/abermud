<P>

Oh foolish adventurer, you have gone too far North up the M1 and met up
with the infamous Lorry.
<P>

You immediately notice his presence by the impact of his windscreen on
your forehead, and the increased weight of your backpack!!
<P>

Yes...You have been run over by Lorry. 
<P>

 Vroom ......o---oP
<P>

Perhaps you will fare better next time.. 
if there is a next time that is.....
<P>

<B>#DIE</B>

<P>

Of course as you you have been able to withstand Lorry crashing into you
and you can stay around to watch others less fortunate than yourself,
getting run over.
<P>

Exits available to you are Up to the Wizards Room Down to the Pit or
South to the Service Cafe.
<P>

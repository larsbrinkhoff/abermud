<P>

You find yourself on a misty path that seems to lead towards a strange
forest, or perhaps a wood!!
<P>

You feel compelled to visit this majestic place, and do not even feel
deterred (yet!) by a small sign set in the ground in front of you, which
quite simply states...
<P>

 Turn back now, or meet thy doom.
 Televisions can be harmful to your health!!!
<P>

You can turn back from the wood and go west if you don't have any
Carling Black Label, or head on in eastwards...to who knows what!
<P>

<H1>You are in a small...</H1>

<A HREF=amud176.html>[east: 176]</A>
<A HREF=amud174.html>[west: 174]</A>
<P>

You are in a small box like room with black walls and black floor and
ceilings, yet it is still lit by some form of unnatural magic.
<P>

On one wall a large picture of a ritual sacrafice has been painted onto
the wall, not leaving any room for doubt as to the purpose of the altar
at the other side of the room.
<P>

Exits lead east and west.

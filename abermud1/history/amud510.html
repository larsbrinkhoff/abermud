Hundreds of empty barrels stand here in the gloom, sticky with treacle,
around a vast well in the centre of the room from the depths of which
can occasionally be heard a faint *gloop* sound.

A sign on the wall says:
<P>

Hello to all my fans out there, Rachel for the coffee, her room-mate
Fiona for not blackmailing me and all the others... hehehehehe
<P>

And a real big thankyou to "Tracy"
<P>

You can go east only, to the factory floor.

Milton Keynes - The Centre of the Known Universe
<P>

A vast structure rears its ugly head before you, belching steam and
other less attractive vapours.. In front of you, just visible through
the mist (not MIST) is a huge statue of a strange hairy man wearing
shades.. all in pure white polystyrene. Arthur Smith stands nearby,
drying his washing over a Bilocation Conduit and causing havoc in
Bermuda.
<P>

The High Street runs at the feet of the statue from east to west,
littered with paper cups.

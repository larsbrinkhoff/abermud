<P>

You climb into the airduct and find that the atmosphere is hot and
clammy. You can hear computer buzz coming from both ends of the airduct
and neither reassures you of your safety. The ventilation system itself
is old and noisy, and would have many tributary airways leading into and
out of this pipe if Moog the creator had enough time to write them...so
remind him please!
<P>

The airduct leads east and west.

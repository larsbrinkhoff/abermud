<A HREF=amud148.html>[south: 148]</A>
<P>

Going down onto all fours you manage to crawl into and along this small
side tunnel. It is evidently a recent digging, and quite soon you reach
the end. In front of you is a rock fall, completely blocking the
tunnel, and there is no way forward at all (yet!!...Moog the Creator).
The only available exit is back south down the tunnel.
<P>

Exits lead south only.

<P>

You are standing in the lobby of a huge dark building. Pipes, all sizes
and different colours, run along the ceiling, down the walls, along the
floor and up the other side, disappearing into strange machines and vats
containing slowly curdling GUNK. The floor is slippery, wet and brown.
<P>

To the north is a small door, to the east a dim archway, and to the
west, hidden behind a machine which is busy mixing vile liquids, is a
dark damp passageway. A stairwell is in the centre of the room leading
down into a quiet room from which noxious vapours swirl.

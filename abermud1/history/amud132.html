<P>

You have entered Rim C, and boy is it interesting or what! Many people
would say that this is the centre of the Universe, but you know that
that's Doiley Woods, or is it Milton Keynes. Of course you could always
bench test Bullet II against Honeyboard!!!

A corridor leads west, off to the Hub.

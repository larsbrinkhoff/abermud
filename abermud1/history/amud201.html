You emerge to find yourself in the legendary Sun Lounge of Aberystwyth
University. You have heard many an evening tale told of this place when
you sat by the fireside, but never really believed the stories. This
room was sealed up after the famous, if not imfamous, Ada revolution and
riots of late 1988, when the Computer Science staff rebelled, and sent
Ada packing to the lowest depths available.
<P>

As you look around the room in wonder you realise that it is not dead,
but that power is being fed into the terminals via a jockey lead coming
in through a hole in the wall. The row of ancient Sun computers was
covered in a tick layer of dust, but now has been wiped clean and the
computers are working.
<P>

It would seem to you that a relative of one or other of the computer
science staff has found a way into the Sun Lounge and is preparing to
let forth the stored wrath of years of silence. You notice a terminal
alight with text, and you could sit Down at it, or you can climb into
the ventilation system to your west.

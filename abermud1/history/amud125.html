<P>

You emerge, and have to shield your eyes from the bright light which
greets you. After half a minute your eyes can take the brightness, and
you lower your hands.
<P>

Before you is set a brilliant white room, one side of which is given
over to screens and keyboards. At the far end you can make out two
figures in white crouched over a terminal; they seem too engrossed to
notice you, even to the point of ignoring your attempts to call to them,
and you notice that they are in a small glass cell of their own,
unbreakable and self contained. You can see a service lift in the
corner of the room, but a sign hanging off it informs you that all
access to lower levels is forbidden by any users under security
clearence AlphaII.
<P>

A swing door leads westwards, a heavy, rusted iron door southwards, a
hacked tunnel eastwards, or the lift could take you up or down(!!).
<P>

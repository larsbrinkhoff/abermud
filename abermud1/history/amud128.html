***WARNING***WARNING***SECURITY BREACH***WARNING***WARNING***
<P>

Oh dear it seems that your personal security clearance is not high
enough to allow access to the lower levels. The opperators take such a
high view of any security breaches of this high a category that the
penalty is automatic death, carried out by the maintenance robots
designed in the Aberystwyth Artificial Intelligence sector.
<P>

This ruling has been put into immediate operation and before you have
even had a chance to look at the reams and reams of computer printout
stored down in these levels the robots strike, and you are painlessly
eliminated by lethal poison. The advice from Moog the Creator is to
stay well clear of the lower levels until you have the correct security
clearence!

Well whats a little poison between friends, it just tickles a bit! So
now you can watch others come down here who arent immune to poison.
HAVE FUN...
<P>

Your Exits are Up the maintenance lift, or Down to the Wizards room.

The smell of sawdust and fresh (and of course very expensive) leather
greets you as you step into the wizards bar. So far the vital equipment
has not been installed, so you will have to wait a while to hear White
the Wizard singing in Gaelic again...... There is a notice on the
counter scribbled with the words: "Of course I'll marry you, now get
back into bed!" A doorway leads south into the wizards room.

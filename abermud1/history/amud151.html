<A HREF=amud150.html>[east: 150]</A>
<A HREF=amud152.html>[west: 152]</A>
<P>

You find yourself on a fertile stretch of land, with many small shrubs
and trees around you. You notice immediately the strength of the sun,
for it is very warm here.
<P>

To the east is a shimmering, luminous rock wall with no obvious
markings, in fact the light seems to bounce straight off it.

Exits lead west.

<H1>You are in what would...</H1>

<A HREF=amud185.html>[east: 185]</A>
<P>

You are in what would appear to have been the armoury of the Pyramid
Guards, as sword racks line one wall, and various impressions of
crossbows and the like can be seen on the wall.
<P>

Unfortunately the heavy wooden door that kept this room secure has been
smashed apart unceremoniously, and the wooden splinters lie around the
frame of the entrance.
<P>

Not much has been left unbroken in this room by who or whatever raided
it, though it is also apparent that nothing much was stolen only
smashed, suggesting that he/she/it has no need of normal weapons!
<P>

Exits lead east through the doorway.

You have entered Maddie's office, which you immediately see to be tidily
kept, and decorated to match the woman who works there. From the plush
pink settee at one side to the exotic oil paintings hanging from the
walls this room reflects the image of Maddie - it is both tasteful and
very good looking. Apart from the fact that Madilyn Hayes works here
there is nothing extraordinary about this office.
<P>

The door in the southern wall leads out to the reception area, and a
door in west wall takes you into the Executive Washroom.

To the east is a large red door marked 'Fire Exits Only'.

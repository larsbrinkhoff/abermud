<P>

Oh dear, you should never have come into this corner of the wood,
because this is where Evil Edna lives, and if she's here then she will
be angry! Evil Edna doesn't like anyone, least of all nosey adventurers,
so beware.
<P>

The path leads west and south from here, either of which would be a good
idea.

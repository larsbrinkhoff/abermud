<P>

You stand at the top of a tall cliff looking north, down into a deep
valley. Huge rocks at the bottom offer the delights of total oblivion,
to become another smashed wreck at its base.
<P>

If you are in no hurry, a narrow cliff path also leads down to the north
descending down a fissure in the cliff itself. To the south a path runs
towards a large tower, to the west is a burger bar

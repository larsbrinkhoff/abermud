You are standing at the top of the Wall. Below you is Wall Street, and
there are handholds in the Wall so that you can climb back down. To the
east is a deep chasm about a yard wide, and then one side of a
skyscraper. You can see through the window opposite into a woman's
bedroom, judging by all the Pink.

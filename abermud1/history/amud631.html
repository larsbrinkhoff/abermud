You are at the southern end of the valley, The trees continue north east
and west from here, but to the south everything ends in a huge black
cliff, which soars high up above you at close to vertical for several
hundred feet. On its top your eyes seem to catch the flicker of
something glittering. A narrow rocky crack leads south down the
narrowing gap between the cliffs

Whats that rushing up towards you very fast, very fast indeed?
<P>

(You wonder if it will be friends with you)
<P>

Well the answer is that it wont... Your attempts to get into the book
of records have succeded, but the ground seems to have confiscated your
life for now...

As you are a very high level character the ground immediately gives your
life back to you, and you still make it into the Guiness Book of
Records.
<P>

Exits for you are up to the rope again down to the pyramid base or north
to the Wizards Room.

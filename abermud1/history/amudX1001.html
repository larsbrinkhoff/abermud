<H1>You enter a BLACK room....</H1>

<P>

You enter a BLACK room. The interior decorator was either intensely
depressed, or genuinely insane, as all walls, floor, and ceiling are
painted black. 
<P>

This is the sort of black that makes standing in a railway tunnel in the
middle of a moonless night, whilst wearing a crash-helmet backwards look
positively luminescent. 
<P>

The only light seeps slowly from a trapdoor in the floor, as though
rather ashamed to be here. That light flickers around the edges, and
also seems to be the source of the heat in the room, which is somewhat
stifling. A predictably black cat comes forwards and sits on your foot,
purring gently, and licking it's forepaws, as if in anticipation. 
Across the trapdoor from you, a large padded leather chair swings
around, and a taloned hand gestures towards you. 
<P>

A voice, both warm and cold, says, "Glad you could come." The trapdoor
opens, and the Being in the chair begins to laugh, in a Daemonic sort of
way. 
<P>

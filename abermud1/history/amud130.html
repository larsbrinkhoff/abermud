A sign reads: Welcome to Bullet II
<P>

You have entered the bulletin board of UCL successfully. In this room
you can see a wall painting of large, heavy, broken, cartwheel, with
only four spokes remaining.
<P>

Scrawled messages refer, in none too elequent a manner, to the apparent
speed (or lack of it) of the Bullet II system, and the obvious borrowing
from HoneyBoard (in everything but speed!!!).
<P>

Corridors lead off north, south, east and west, whilst an open trap door
leads down into the murky depths of Hackers Delight, and stone steps
upwards.

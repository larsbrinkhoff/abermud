<P>

You have walked into David Addisons office, which you don't need me to
tell you as you have eyes to see the state of the place. This certainly
is Davids office, as papers lie everywhere, the drinks fridge is open
and almost emptied of its stock, and silly (in fact zany) novelty items
cover his desk.
<P>

All in all this office is a mess (though you do find it quite homely) as
Maddie has been telling him since the first series. You can see a
poster on the wall of a once famous rock character called Bruno
Raddolini, but apart from this the office is plain.
<P>

A door leads north to the reception area, and another west to the
washroom.

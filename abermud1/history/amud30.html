<H1>Hole in the Wall</H1>

You emerge through the Mist, and find yourself up against a brick wall,
perfect in appearance save for a large gaping hall high above you.
Graffitied in front of you is the message...
<P>

 With love from the FGMP 15 xxxxx

It is certainly too high for you to reach at the moment, but with a
little more creating it will be near enough for you to climb through.
You can go back north at the moment to go somewhere else, as from the
smoke, Mist, and sounds drifting through the hole the new area behind
the wall is being created at this very moment, and raw magic shoots past
your head to prove this theory! A small path leads east towards a mound.

<H1>You are in a small...</H1>

<A HREF=amud176.html>[north: 176]</A>
<A HREF=amud179.html>[south: 179]</A>
<A HREF=amud181.html>[west: 181]</A>
<P>

You are in a small square room with no distinctive features except for a
message scratched on the wall in what looks like black blood:
<P>

BEWARE THE TUKANA......
<P>

The message ends promptly as though the writer was disturbed, and the
writing itself is obviously not thousands of years old!
<P>

Exits lead north (through a purple curtain) south and west.

You have emerged into a totally synthetic universe, created for your
conveience in this part of the adventure (well you wouldnt like to be
put up against the real thing would you!!).
<P>

You find yourself in the reception area of the famous Blue Moon
Detective Agency, although it is after office hours and so it is devoid
of life. You can see the reception desk where Miss Depesto works, and
the various desks at which the other staff work, and limbo-dance at.
<P>

A door in the north wall leads into Maddies office, a door in the south
wall leads into David's office, whilst the main door takes you west and
a glowing blue portal (as yet unseen in the series) shimers to the east.

You are standing in a small dry cave, with a low roof some six feet
high. The cavemouth is to the north but is twisted enough that you
cannot see out, and it also provides good shelter against the wind. To
the south a narrow and low arched opening leads into another cave. The
cave is clean and evidently well used by its occupant although who he
is, its hard to tell.

You are in a ministry of defence missile silo, hidden deep in the heart
of doiley woods. Signs on the wall proclaim things like 'Make war not
love - its safer', and 'Careless talk costs wives'. A set of floodlit
concrete steps lead back out of this concrete hole into the bright
cheery air of the forest.

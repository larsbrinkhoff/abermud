This is the centre of Doiley Woods, some would say the centre of the
Universe, for it is the residence of the Moog, that all knowledgable (!)
creature whose legs don't always touch the ground.

The path leads north, south, east and west from here, and a small rope
ladder leads upwards, to the top of the central tree.

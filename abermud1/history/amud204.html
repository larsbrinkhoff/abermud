<P>

You find yourself in a grotty little travel agency ('Taccy Tours').
There are many peeling posters advertising the fact for a mere `99 you
can spend a 'nice' week in a 'nice' Spanish hotel where the people are
very nice, the weather is perfect, the beer is cheap, and the women are
loose, but in fact from your past experiences you know that the hotel is
unbuilt, the people are complete idiots, the beer is piss, and the women
are donkeys (apologies to donkeys everywhere and to Veryodd).
<P>

You can see three exits... the door to the north is labelled Raunchy
River Cruise, the door to the east is labelled Waccy Western Weeks, the
door to the west is labelled Monty Magical Months.
<P>

It seems that this was one of those shops (now failed) which appears in
a nondescript wall for no reason. You may not leave this shop except
via a tour package, as the front door is now a brick wall...and you cant
find the cursed owner to help you out.
<P>

So, come on down Mr. Adventurer, and pick a 'fab' holiday...
Well...its one way to make a living...

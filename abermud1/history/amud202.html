You sit down at the active Sun Computer, and begin to read the
information splayed across the screen. The jist of the information is
headed under the title...
<P>

 Ada's Revenge Plan
<P>

Under which you can see a sketch plan for world domination of Ada, and
the merciless pursual and execution of minor languages. It is 'signed'
at the bottom... "D Price IV"
<P>

The program appears to very recent, and the originator of this dastardly
plan cannot be very far away.

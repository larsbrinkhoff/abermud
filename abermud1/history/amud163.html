<P>

You find yourself (well who else did you expect?) on a low sandy
plateau, which seems to have been revealed by a receeding desert. You
are therefore obviously in a part of this land which has not been
exposed to man for centuries, so who knows what awaits in what you can
now see is a pyramid in the far western side of the plateau!
<P>

Exits lead east and west.

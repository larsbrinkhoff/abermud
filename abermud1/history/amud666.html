<H1>Atropos' Torture Room</H1>

<P>

<P>

You are in what seems to be a room filled with electronic items of one
persuasion or another. Upon closer inspection their use and identity
become clear to you: they are instruments of computer torture... shoes
with datastreams at right angles with itself and another with large
magnets surrounding it to just name a few.

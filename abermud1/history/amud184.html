<P>

You are in a room which has blazing torches fixed to the wall.
<P>

It most certainly seems to be in use by someone or something, and an
unpleasant smell hits your nose as you enter the room.
<P>

Stone steps in one corner lead downwards a doorless doorway leads
northward and an unnatural passageway to the west.

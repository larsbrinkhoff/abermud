You have wandered into a corner of the forest inhabited by a rather
large, orange caterpillar (a relative of Quorthon?). His corner of the
forest is rather untidy, and the only thing you can make out to be of
any use is a picture hanging up on a tree showing a large orange
butterfly.
<P>

The path leads east and south from here.

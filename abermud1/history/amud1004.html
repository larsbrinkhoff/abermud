You are standing in a small corridor, the officers cabins are north east

There is a large 'piece' of grafitti on the wall proclaiming the fact
that you are now at the edge of sanity/reality and that if you read this
sign you will slowly fade out of reality to point of vanishing in a
flurry of absolutely no underwear other than the ones worn by the
albatross in return to the past!

This huge hall is another tribute to the skilled stonework of the
dwarves A circular hall with a spectacular painted domed roof that seems
lost in the shadows high above you. From the walls spectacularly carved
gargoyles leer down attempting to put you off your food. Passages lead
north east and west.

You are standing beside a small, smooth pool, fed from a stream which
runs in from the north. The cool shallow waters of the pool flicker and
dance with the breeze, reflecting the swaying trees, and the tiny dark
specks of the thousands of insects which dart back and forth around you.
Paths lead through the forest in all directions from here.

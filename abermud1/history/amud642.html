You are climbing a set of steep, slippery stairs that lead up into the
church tower. Water runs down the steps, collecting in mossy pools,
where the cracks and dips in the stonework allow it. The steps turn
from stone to wood up above, and look very dodgy. To the west a doorway
leads out into the pulpit.

<P>

This is it...the place to be..you have entered Rim D, and it is living
up to all your expectations.
<P>

You notice on one wall a rather sordid tale concerning the Famous Five
written out in blood (from some Whalemeat perhaps), and it makes
entertaining reading for at least forty two seconds.
<P>

A corridor leads east, towards the Hub.

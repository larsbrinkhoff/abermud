<H1>Straight stretch of M1</H1>

Having decided not to go north the only other logical choice was to send
you into the M25.
<P>

This really is a nightmare, as there are promises of traffic jams, lane
closures, road works and other motorway delights without so much as a
service station.....
<P>

The motorway leads back north, and continues south, west and east.

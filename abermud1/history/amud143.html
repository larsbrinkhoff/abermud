<H1>Fire Exit...but not an exit in sight!</H1>

<P>

<P>

Oh dear...didn't you read the sign, this door is only an exit for fires
(I told you this is the zany section).
<P>

You unfortunately are not a fire, and therefore cannot use this exit, in
fact the punishment for trying to break the gaming rules is the lack of
available exits...see nothing works.
<P>

In fact your only available exit is out of the game, and thus any
treasure you are now carrying will be left here, so on rejoining the
game please inform a wizard or creator of the situation who will rectify
it, and possibly return some items to you....
<P>

Creator who enjoys this kind of humour...heeheehee

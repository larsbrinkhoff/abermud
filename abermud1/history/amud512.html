You are in the basement of the factory at the foot of some stairs. This
is a huge room, with a cobbled floor. The only source of light is a
gigantic caricature of a Victorian gas lamp in the middle, around which
smoke curls slowly.
<P>

In the corner of the room a front loading washing machine languishes in
bondage..

<P>

<P>

You reach the top of the stairs and begin to feel queasy due to the
stench that hits your nose.
<P>

As you step into what is obviously a sadistic food preparation room
(kitchen to some people) you eyes pop out in horror at the sight that
hits you.
<P>

The proprieter of this esteemed establishment obviously has a sadistic
dislike of frogs for dead frog carcases lie all around, and sadistic
instruments of frog torture abound. Frogs legs seem to be the order of
the day, and many are to be found hanging from available appendages.
<P>

The stench begins to overpower you, and you feel ill (the sight does not
help either), and you feel compelled to leave as quickly as possible.
<P>

The stairs lead back down again.

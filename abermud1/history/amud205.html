<P>

Due to unforeseen difficulties in the holiday season, well really its
the problems with the creators workload, you know how it is being a
creator, no you don't really do you, and you cant even begin to
speculate!
<P>

Anyway...im afraid the package tours aren't ready for receiving guests
yet, so in the mean while here is some music to pass the time... You
may move in any direction from here to reappear at the pit, this message
is for your convenience, and will not explode in five seconds...
<P>

Thankyou... Moog the Guitar Wizard Creator

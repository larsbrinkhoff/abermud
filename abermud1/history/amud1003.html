You are standing on the bridge of the USS Elan, a vast wid screen showing
a tasteful picture of the stars (eg Anarchy and White). The east end of
the room is the captains chair, a tasteful construction in black
plastic.There is a radio set into the bridge, with a button marked
recieve on it, (Can you resist Pushing it ?).

The Mega Elevator Thingy Is South.

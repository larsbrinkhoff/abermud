<P>

You are in the desert of many fools, and it seems to go on forever in
every direction. It is a sea of sand, with not a variation on the sand
dune theme anywhere, wait.. was that an ice cream stand..no only a
mirage.
<P>

Exits lead north to an ice cream stand, south towards the desert edge,
west, and east.

You are greeted by the sight of a long wooden banqueting table, which
has been cleared of its delicacies by The Beast.
<P>

Apart from the table this area is quite bare and uninteresting, well do
you know what its like being a Beast eh!
<P>

The Woodland path leads west, south, and north (to a darker area!).

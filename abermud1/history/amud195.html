<A HREF=amud196.html>[up: 196]</A>
<P>

You climb up through the trap door and remembering how you were trapped
<P>

before, try to keep it from shutting, but to no avail. The trap door is
obviously under some form of magical control and nothing can stop it
from shutting. From this side it appears to form a solid floor, and no
amount of searching or forcing finds a way to open it again.
<P>

You are now at the very peak of the pyramid, which is inlaid with gold
leaf. Statues of the gods line the walls and a perfect stillness fills
the room- you cannot even hear the wind here.
<P>

A window, well its really a large hole in the eastern wall, is the only
other noticeable feature of the room, and through it you can see a rope
leading upwards.
<P>

The only available exit from here is up the rope...

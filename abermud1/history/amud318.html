You stand in the dwarven great hall, a huge carved room of spectacular
design, with a massive fan vaulted ceiling. The spectacular arches and
pillars are all decorated with dwarvish battle scenes and high up (out
of reach) Dwarven momentos of great age are hung, golden banners,
shining axes and helms and many other items of war and craft. High
arched exits lead North, East and South. A set of narrow stairs in one
corner lead down into the cellars A wide sweeping staircase leads up to
a high balcony overlooking the hall.

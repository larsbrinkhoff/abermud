You find yourself in a very small, bright white, box like room, with a
golden plaque at one end which informs you of its purpose. The plaque
quite simply states...
<P>

 Camtec Ethergate Room
<P>

The room has a form of reverence about it, for you are in the presence
of the legendery Ethergate. In the room is a single unit, which you
understand to be the Ethergate itself and a large Red Button on a gold
plinth, labelled **RESET**
<P>

The lift will take you down, but you notice an open airduct in the east
wall.

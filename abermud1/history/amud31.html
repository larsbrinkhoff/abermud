You arrive at the top of a large mound, from where you can see over the
top of the wall, but there is no chance of getting over from here.
Looking over, through the Mist and magic, you can see, far away in the
distance, strange shapes. Eventually you recognise them as some form of
building which has sunk into the ground, and whose outline now reads, in
the local tongue, 'Go stick your head in a pig!'. The buildings were
once the complaints department of the Sirius Cybernetics
Corporation...company motto 'Share and Enjoy'...which took up the ground
area of two thirds of a small planet, and kept three others in permanent
employment! Maybe, one day, you might be able to visit the now crumbling
buildings, and unearth dark secrets of the olden days...but right now
you'll have to take the path back west.

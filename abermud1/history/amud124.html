You find yourself crawling along a long, small tunnel (possibly a
service tunnel of some sort). After several minutes of crawling you
eventually see light at the end of the tunnel, but do you really want to
find out what is so obviously kept out of harms way!!!

The tunnel stretches off to the east and west.

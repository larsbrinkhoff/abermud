<P>

You are in the tunnel still, which still seems to be horizontal.
<P>

The floor of this section has been smoothed off, and clear evidence can
be seen of recent digging on the tunnel walls. In particular a small
side tunnel leads off to the north, but to go down it you will have to
crawl...
<P>

Available exits are north (into the side tunnel) west and east.

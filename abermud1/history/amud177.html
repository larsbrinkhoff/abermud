<H1>You are in what appears...</H1>

<A HREF=amud167.html>[south: 167]</A>

<P>

You are in what appears to have been the guard room for the pyramid.
<P>

Rows of bunks (for about thirty men) fill one half of the room, whilst
the other has a long table for eating at. Some cutlery, or its ancient
equivalent, still remains on the table, and the decayed form of food can
be seen. This room has a considerable dust covering, but what makes
this room make you feel uneasy is the tracks leading through the
dust...not even a form of foot that you have seen before!
<P>

Exits lead south and west.

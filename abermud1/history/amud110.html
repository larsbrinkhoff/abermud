<P>

<P>

You feel quite humble, and bow down when you enter this room. On each
of the the four walls you can see a massive, floodlight, gold framed,
portrait of one of the four creators of this game, namely... Anarchy
the Cardboard Box on the east wall, White the Creator on the southern
wall, Atropos the Wanderer on the western wall, and Moog the Guitar
Wizard on the northern wall.
<P>

This room is obviously a shrine to the four greatest creators in this
universe, and I would strongly advise no attempt at defacing it, because
the last person to try this is now stretched out on the floor (one
Hobbit) for you to tread on...what else are hobbits for? You can hear
whimpers of pain from the creature, but cannot seem to reach it!
<P>

You hear the words 'Good Luck! hee hee hee hee!' whispered in your ear
as you stand here, but cannot find the source, was it one of the
wizards, or even one of the Creators, for they see and know all!
<P>

Exits lead off in all four directions through veils of Mist, and you
begin to wonder what the Creators have in mind for you...

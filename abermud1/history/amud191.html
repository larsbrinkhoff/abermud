<H1>You step into the flames...</H1>

<A HREF=amud192.html>[up: 192]</A>
<A HREF=amud194.html>[down: 194]</A>
<P>

You step into the flames and are amazed to find that although you could
feel the heat from outside there is no heat here, and a feeling of
magical powers surges through you as you are transported upwards. The
power seems to be neutral, neither attacking you nor helping you beyond
doing its job here, and you are given a choice to continue upwards to
the gods or to choose to return to the temple (although this is not
advisable as there will be shock from the reverse journey).
<P>

Thus you choose... up or down.

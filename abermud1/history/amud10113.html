<P>

<P>

You are following a path up a cliff. The path ends abruptly to the east
where it used to cross a ravine on a bridge. The bridge has been
phasered by some vandal, who seems to have been busy on the cliff to.
<P>

A copy of captain James T Burk has been cut into it along with a large
number of rude comments about hobbits, which cannot be repeated here.

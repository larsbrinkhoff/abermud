<H1>You are in a long...</H1>

<P>

You are in a long hallway inside the pyramid, which would appear to be
the equivalent to the modern reception area. It is made of sandstone as
is the whole pyramid structure.
<P>

Although obviously thousands of years old it has been preserved by the
desert and is near to its original state of repair. At the moment this
area is magically lit and you can see every detail clearly.
<P>

A thin layer of dust coats the floor, but everywhere you look you can
see tracks, suggesting that since the pyramid was built it has not been
quite as dead as one would have hoped!
<P>

Exits lead east out into the desert, north, and south.

You find yourself in a temple of some kind, with a large altar at one
end and steps leading up into a large basin. As you approach the steps
flames spring up in it, which would engulf anyone placed in the bowl.
It seems to you that this is a method of ritual sacrafice to the gods.
Steps lead up to the rim of the bowl.....

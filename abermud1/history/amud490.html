<P>

You are standing on the edge of a giant banana, which stretches away
into
<P>

the distance. The edges of the banana appear to have holes in them, in
fact it appears to be a tractor feed banana To the north you can see the
gleaming spires of Milton Keynes although knowing the average tractor
feed banana you could probably never come back this way again To the
south is the cliff edge.

<P>

You are walking along a narrow, low passage which seems to curve around
the base of the pyramid. The tracks in the dust still worry you, and
the whole place is beginning to get at you as thoughts of a horrible
death keep recurring in your mind- not a thing that would usually happen
to you.

Exits lead east and west.

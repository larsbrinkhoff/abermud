<P>

Unfortunately the power, now revealed to you as a demigod, was correct
when telling you that some shock may occur from the reverse journey.
<P>

The transition is quick, but the pain felt upon materialising in the
temple lasts only momentarily (as you realize that your body is inside
out when you land) before you pass away...
<P>

Your remains will not even litter the temple for long as an accelerated
decay sets in. Soon the only thing to show that you were once in this
place will be a pair of smouldering boots...
<P>

<P>

As you are a high level character your body does not appreciate what has
been done to it and promptly flips back to its normal state of
existence.
<P>

You are here in a zone of nothingness... but luckily exits for you are
down to the temple up to the wizards room or north to the top of the
pit.
<P>

You stand on the edge of the forest, which extends south east and west
as far as you can see. To the north the trees give way to a grassy
hill. A narrow worn path leads north up the hill. To the south the
path through the forest is almost blocked by thick hedges, but a few
gaps enable you to squeeze through.

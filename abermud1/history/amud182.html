<H1>You are in what appears...</H1>

<A HREF=amud183.html>[south: 183]</A>

<P>

You are in what appears to be the present sleeping quarters of whatever
it is that is living in the pyramid now. The 'bed' consists of old
bedding, cloaks (of past adventurers) and various items of clothing.
Luckily the owner of this bed is not here at the moment, which is lucky
for you as by the length of the bed he (or she - lets not be sexist)
would appear to be over eight feet tall minimum!
<P>

Exits lead south and west.

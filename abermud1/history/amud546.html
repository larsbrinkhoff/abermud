<H1>Nikki's Room</H1>

<A HREF=amud542.html>[north: 542]</A>

This is the room where all the noise is coming from.. a stereo lies on
the floor playing BOB MARLEY very very loudly. The rest of the room is
quite small, with clothes flung everywhere- over the bed, over the
chair, over the ironing board/desk...
<P>

There is a Valentine's Card here for Nikki signed "WtC"...
<P>

Another card, clearly of magical and immovable nature, reads "Thanks",
nothing more nothing less...
<P>

A doorway leads north.

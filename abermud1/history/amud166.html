<P>

As you reach the base of the pyramid you see that it is made of
sandstone, and that the surface is very smooth. It seems to purvey some
kind of magical feeling, which is not all together good.
<P>

You can see an open archway leading into the side of the pyramid, and
you presume that someone or something has got here before you, and made
their way inside... There is nothing of any consequence beyond the
pyramid in any direction (yet!) in fact you can see the edge of the
created world from here.
<P>

The only exits available are east to the sandy plateau or west into the
pyramid.

<H1>You have now reached one...</H1>

<A HREF=amud154.html>[east: 154]</A>
<P>

You have now reached one extreme of the desert, and in front of you is
an oasis, complete with palm trees and drinking well (not yet in
operation...Moog the creator).
<P>

Eventually you may even be able to accomplish somthing at this well but
so far the gods attentions have not turned towards this area.
<P>

Exits lead off east.

<H1>The Silver Lake</H1>

<P>

<P>

You are in a huge room, the centre of which is dominated by a vast lake
of quicksilver. Beams of white light come streaming down from a hole in
the ceiling reflecting off of the surface with the ripples in the lake.
It is so large you cant see to the other side, and it also has tides...
<P>

The only exit off of the white sand beach on which you stand is a door
to the north.

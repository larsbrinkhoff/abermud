You stand in Ada's once beautiful drawing room, now a decaying shadow of
its former glory, the wallpaper peeling to reveal the cracked plaster

is since Ada was last here. The huge fireplace to the south lies cold
and blackened, no longer giving forth its warm radiance. A single
doorway leads north

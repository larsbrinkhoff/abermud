You are standing on a mystical dockside, before you is a large
ceremonial boat, with candles adorning the sides and incense burning.
The boat is a pure white (or should that be moog) example of
engineering, and a gangplank leads north up onto the top deck.
<P>

The boat looks ready to sail, just awaiting its passenger... There is a
small building to your east, which looks like something to do with the
ceremony.

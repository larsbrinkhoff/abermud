<H1>You are in a long...</H1>

<A HREF=amud175.html>[east: 175]</A>

<P>

You are in a long low narrow passageway which curves around the base of
the pyramid. The tracks in the dust have almost died out now, and you
are much more at ease now.
<P>

This area, like the rest of the rooms you have visited, seems to be
magically lit at the moment.
<P>

Exits lead east and south.

<P>

<P>

You are following a path up a cliff. The path ends abruptly to the east
where it used to cross a ravine on a bridge. The bridge has been
phasered by some vandal, who seems to have been busy on the cliff too.
<P>

A copy of Kirk's face has been cut into the cliff along with a large
collection of rude messages about hobbits, which are too rude to repeat
here.

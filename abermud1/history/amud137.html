<P>

<P>

Congratulations you have reached Hackers Delight, a small, but not
insignificant, area of Bullet II from which you have direct access to
all the persona files on record, and direct control over all users of
the system...you are in effect a god in the machine.
<P>

The surprising thing is that it was so amazingly easy to hack your way
into the system...
<P>

The hacking tunnel leads upwards towards the hub, and potential exits
lead elsewhere...maybe they will be implemented in the near future.
<P>

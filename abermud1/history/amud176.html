<H1>You are in a large...</H1>

<A HREF=amud177.html>[east: 177]</A>

<P>

You are in a large room, brightly lit, with ornamental drapes and
carvings covering the walls. On the southern wall is a large plush
purple curtain, which has not decayed at all.
<P>

This room has no dust covering at all but seems to give you the creeps
anyway...
<P>

Exits lead east and west.

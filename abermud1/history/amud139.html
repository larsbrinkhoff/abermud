You emerge to find yourself in front of a large Archway, made of grey
stone. Painted on its surface is a picture of the night sky as seen
from this point, except that the moon in this depiction is blue in
colour.
<P>

The Archway leads through to the west, and a tunnel goes sloping down to
the east.

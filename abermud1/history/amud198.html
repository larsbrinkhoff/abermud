<H1>You reach the end of...</H1>

<A HREF=amud206.html>[north: 206]</A>
<A HREF=amud207.html>[east: 207]</A>
<P>

You reach the end of the rope and find that this area of the adventure
has brought you up to a strange blanket of clouds.
<P>

To the north you can see a mystical ship, perhaps to bear the dead
pharoahs off to the gods. Apart from going to the ship, there is a
small path leading east, but can you walk on clouds beacause it doesn't
look very safe for you.

<H1>As you step up out...</H1>

<A HREF=amud193.html>[south: 193]</A>
<P>

As you step up out of the flame you find yourself in a room of grey
stone. There is no sign of a way back down to the temple, and you are
not even sure that you would survive such a journey twice anyway as you
feel quite shakey and weak after the trip upwards.
<P>

You reorientate yourself and notice that the floor of this room has been
made into a complex pattern of colour and shapes, quite literally
straining your eyes to look at.
<P>

Exits from here are south through a door.

You are standing in a tiny little cubbyhole of a room.. how it manages
to contain a huge sheepdog you will never know... On the walls are
pictures of yet more hairy monsters (otherwise known as octopi) (huh?).
There is a stereo here BEHIND AN UNBREAKABLE GLASS DOOR playing Free
tapes.. There is a door to the south.

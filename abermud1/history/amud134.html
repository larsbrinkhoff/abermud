<P>

Well here you are, arrived at Rim B on the Euclid Bullet II system.
What fun it all is...lots to do
<P>

For example you could complete the Famous Five Novel, or go onto talker
and add to stimulating conversation about Life, the Universe and
Zebedee. You notice wall scrawlings which seem to portray a severe
dislike of the above mentioned character Zebedee, but don't worry..for
here he is not immune to the Chainsaw, FGMP 15, or even the Wet
Kipper...try it!!!
<P>

A corridor leads off to the north.

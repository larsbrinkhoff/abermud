<P>

You are in what appears to be some form of storeroom for the pyramid,
although anything that was kept here has now decayed to dust, or has it?
You can still make out tracks in the dust covering the floor of this
room, but do not recognise any foot that made this kind of imprint...
This area too is magically lit for the moment.
<P>

Exits lead east and west.

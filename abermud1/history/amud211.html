You are inside the Mystical Port Authority's Hut, and on the table you
can see mystical charts (this means that you cant touch them), and you
cant even begin to comprehend where they are mapping, something to do
with DEATHS house, and The Hall of the Gods, but you cant follow how to
get to these places, yet!
<P>

You notice a trap door in the floor, which has been left open and the
main door is in the west wall. Luckily the Port Authority
Representative is not here at present, having just slipped out for a
quick pint, which for you is quite fortunate, as it would appear to be
DEATH's...

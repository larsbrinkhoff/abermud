<H1>You are in another long...</H1>

<A HREF=amud182.html>[east: 182]</A>
<A HREF=amud188.html>[west: 188]</A>
<P>

You are in another long passageway, but this one is not quite so well
lit (though still by magic). A wind seems to flow down this corridor,
bringing unnatural sounds with it...
<P>

Large cobwebs hang from the ceilings, and bones of some sort lie on the
floor (perhaps the remains of a meal).
<P>

Exits lead east and west.

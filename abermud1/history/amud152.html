<H1>You have entered the deserts...</H1>

<A HREF=amud151.html>[east: 151]</A>
<A HREF=amud153.html>[west: 153]</A>
<P>

You have entered the deserts of many fools, an infamous stretch of land
which has claimed many a life according to legend. The temperature is
extremely high here, in fact clothing is a burden, and it seems more
logical to leave most of it here at the edge of the desert if you wish
to go on...
<P>

Exits lead east out of the desert or west into the desert.

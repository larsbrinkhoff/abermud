You are standing at the bottom of the middle vat.. GUNK is all around
you, caked on to the walls and solidifying. Quite tasty, really. There
is a crack in the wall of the vat, through which GUNK has leaked into
the sewers, causing (so you have heard) horrendous mutations. The crack
is just wide enough for you to climb down into.

<P>

You find yourself in a dingy little Service Cafe.
<P>

In fact you as a hardened adventurer seem out of place here, as you do
not possess a large beer gut, dirty clothes, burnt out fag, and letch
look. As you enter all the patrons of this establishment turn to stare
at you...making you feel most unwelcome in fact.
<P>

But you do not fear anything, especially in a mere Service Cafe, and
stride up to the bar with a swagger.
<P>

The M1 leads north and south, whilst there is a storeroom to the west,
and stairs lead up behind the bar to the kitchens.
<P>

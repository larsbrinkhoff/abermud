You are in a small room at the top of the west tower. It looks out
across a vast expanse of land. As your eyes wander across the skyline
you can pick out the desert of fools, the sea and even milton keynes far
in the distance. Clearly this is the dwarven watch post in times of
war. Stairs lead down.

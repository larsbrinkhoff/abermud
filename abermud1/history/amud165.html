<H1>You are on the western...</H1>

<A HREF=amud163.html>[east: 163]</A>
<A HREF=amud166.html>[west: 166]</A>
<P>

You are on the western edge of the sandy plateau, and before you is a
stunning pyramid, untouched by human hands for many centuries as it was
swallowed up by the desert soon after completion. The land spreading
out from the base of the pyramid, though, is distinctly infertile.
<P>

Exits lead east on the plateau or west to the pyramids base.

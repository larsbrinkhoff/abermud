<P>

You find yourself in a large Wood, and the sound of wild creatures echo
around you...nearby a small sign floats in mid air, just out of reach...
<P>

 Welcome
 To Doiley Woods.
 Please do not feed the Moog.
 (Thankyou)
<P>

The Wood fills you with a feeling of happiness, as though hours of
contented viewing were stored up here.
<P>

A Misty path leads off out of the wood to the west, and in through the
Wood to the north, south and east.

<P>

You reach the end of the path, and stand outside a small hutlike
creation with the word 'Portaloo' written on the outside walls. You
have never seen such a sight before, and the smells are indescribably
obnoxious, you definately feel sick now!
<P>

The path would take you back to the west, or you could go east into the
Portaloo!

<P>

Unfortunately as you dig downwards with your bare hands (in an attempt
to find water??) the sand falls down on top of you, burying you until it
covers your head.
<P>

This is a most horrible way to die, and should not be repeated if you
can help it...

<P>

As the sand covers your head it seems to notice that you are a very high
level character and forms itself into an underground room for you to
rest in or wait to watch other lesser characters fail to survive in...
<P>

Your available exits are north the far edge of the desert, south to the
near edge of the desert, up to the wizards room, or down to the top of
the pit.
<P>

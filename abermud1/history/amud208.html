You find yourself on the upper deck of the mystical boat, which is now
sailing the open skies, obviously no way back off the boat here. The
boat itself is made of a bright white marble, and is quite beautifully
created.
<P>

You do not understand how it is sailing, but it seems to at least.
Steps lead down into a lower deck, and up onto the poop deck. You can
see the marble slab where the intended passenger was supposed to be, but
the boat has taken you as its passenger...to who knows where.

<P>

This is a hideously untidy office.. the walls are covered in
illustrations from the more colourful of the publications on the top
shelf at the news-agents (not a Piglet to be seen) and the desk with
bits of paper, including a Death Warrant for Ghosts, and lots of
"executive toys". The floor, you assume, is somewhere under the
beercans.

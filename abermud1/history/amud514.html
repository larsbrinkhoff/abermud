You are in a ladies bedroom, sumptuously furnished in pink.. A huge
pink double bed lies in the centre of the room, above which are brightly
polished mirrors. Make-up and perfume is arranged tastefully on the
dresser next to a small envelope on which is written the words "To
Fiona- love Dave"
<P>

Another note lies here reading: Still unfinished, but there is a bit
more now... ----) White the Creator
<P>

A door leads east.

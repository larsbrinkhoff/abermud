You are in the lower deck, which were this a mortal creation, would be
the crews quarters, but in this boat it is completely empty. There are
mystical paintings on the walls, showing scenes relating to the dead
king.
<P>

A heavy gold door forms the northern wall, and a porthole in the eastern
wall shows you the ground far, far below you, and steps lead up to the
top deck.
